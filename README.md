## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How should I use this block? ###
Use this block anytime you want to simulate rolling some dice (or a coin flip)! If you're building a character for a Role-Playing Game, try using this block for attack rolls. Each block instance can represent a different weapon or attack, including the attack roll itself, damage, and any bonus or penalty rolls.

### How can I report issues or suggest improvements? ###
